Students compile a collection of their texts in a variety of genres over time and choose two pieces to present for summative assessment. 
In the majority of cases, the work in the student’s collection will arise from normal classwork, as the examples below illustrate. 
 
The annotations capture insights by the student’s teacher, using the features of quality, with a view to establishing the level of achievement the text reflects. 
The purpose of the annotations is to make the teacher's thinking visible. 
The annotations were confirmed by the Quality Assurance group, consisting of practicing English teachers and representatives of the Inspectorate, the SEC and JCT. 
 
The purpose of these examples is to support teachers' professional development. They are not to be used for any other purpose. More examples will be added over time.
